Codeforces Solutions

A curated repository of optimized solutions to Codeforces problems, focused on algorithmic efficiency, correctness, and implementation clarity.

Structure

Problems are organized systematically for fast navigation and consistent review. Each solution reflects practical competitive programming patterns and performance-aware design.

Purpose

This repository serves as:

A long-term archive of solved problems

A reference for algorithmic techniques

A tool for tracking problem-solving progress

Notes

Non-essential build artifacts and local configuration directories are excluded via .gitignore to maintain a clean codebase.
